# WW2-timeline

## What is it?
A horizontally scrolling timeline that dates and describes 40 of the most (in my opinion) important and consequential events of World War 2, dubbed as the "war to end all wars." The site was built using vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and  little bit of JQuery.

## Reflections & Background:
This was the product of one of my assignments from History 12, where Mr. Mergens (one of my all time favourite teachers from highschool), told us to make a timeline with annotations of the 40 most important dates/events of WW2. I really wanted to impress, and rather than doing a Powerpoint presentation like most, I opted to utlize my experience in web development and make a website! With an extra X factor of it being horizontally scrolling.

The problem was that it was much technically challenging than I had expected, as I learned the hard way that HTML and CSS was built around vertically scrolling and as a result getting things to align perfectly was nothing short of a nightmare. Yet despite all the adversity, when I look at how beautiful the final product is I can condifidently say the 70+ hours I put into it was worth it.
