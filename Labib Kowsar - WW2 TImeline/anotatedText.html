                        Also known as the Nanking Massacre, was the atrocities committed by the Japanese troops on the citizens of China’s than capital, Nanking, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the fall of Nanking into Japanese hands, general Matsui Iwane ordered his Japanese soldiers to demolish and destroy Nanking, in an effort to demoralise and crushed Chinese resistance movements in the city. What followed Matsui command was terrifying: 150, 000-200, 000 men — labeled supposedly as “war prisoners” — were butchered by katanas, and over 20, 000 - 80, 000 women of all ages were violently raped, assaulted or mutilated, often dying in the process, by Japanese troops. The Nanking Massacre remains as one of the greatest instances of the abuse of human life in the Asian Theater in, or before, WW2 and it would take decades for the citizens to recover from the savage attacks.

                        The most widely accepted event that began WW2; the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany set the unstoppable train of war on the tracks. This came after the German-Russo pact of Molotov–Ribbentrop, also known as the Non-aggression Pact, and the conquest lasted over a month before Polish resistance collapsed.

                            A period during the beginning of WW2 where seemingly nothing, or very little happened, on the Western Front and was a state of static warfare. The phoney war came after the German’s boisterous blitzkrieg attack on Poland, which resulted in the UK and Frances declaration of war against Nazi Germany. Lasting for 8 months, the phoney began from the fall of 1939 to the spring of 1940 when German forces invaded the low countries and France.

                        Known famously as the longest battle in WW2; the battle of the Atlantic was the greatest naval engagement between the Allies and the Axis over the control of vital supply and trade waters in the Atlantic. Beginning as soon as the British declared war on Nazi Germany, the battle of the Atlantic saw the employment of aircraft and naval destroyers and the fearsome German wolf packs (U-boats). Initially, Germans U-boats and aircraft succeeded in sinking hundreds of Ally supply ships and disrupted the crucial supply of the Allies from North America to Europe. However, with new improvements on radar and aerial technologies on the Ally side, turned the tide of the battle in the Allies favor.

                    <p>
                        Blitzkrieg, German for lighting war, was a very successful and lethal German warfare technique of concentrating forces to spearhead and penetrate enemy fortifications — creating panic and disorganization amongst enemy forces. The Blitzkrieg was employed to have disastrous effects during the German advance into France and the ultimate Fall of France in June 25th of 1940. The Germans penetrated through the heavily forest area known as the Ardennes - thought to be a natural defense - and defeated the out-dated, WW1 style army of France. After the Fall of France, Germany had effectively knocked out one of its greatest foes from WW1, and was the beginning of a German successes in WW2.

                            Winston Churchill was the prime minister of the United Kingdom during WW2 and was elected during the onset of WW2 and increasing German aggression. Churchill is the iconic British figurehead and played a major role in the war by deciding the British’s involvement and dictating much of Britain’s military movements and actions.

                    <p>
                            The Battle of Dunkirk was the defense of allied forces, primarily the BEF (British Expeditionary Force), against the approaching environment of German units until they could be rescued. The evacuation of these soldiers was nothing short of a miracle: fighting against vastly superior German terrestrial and aerial forces, the BEF was in a race against time before their complete annihilation. An annihilation that almost seemed inevitable, caused Churchill to doubt whether the rescue was possible, and as such, the allies did not deploy any significant naval ships. Instead, they relied on every serviceable civilian ship to slowly and methodically extract the soldiers from the beach; an operation that could have deviated at a moments (or German’s) notice. The success of the evacuation marked an exceptional victory for the allies and represents the golden opportunity that the German’s missed to deal a crippling blow to the ally forces.

                <p>
                        The Battle of Britain, part of Operation Sea Lion, was Nazi Germany’s first and last attempt to invade and conquer the formidable nation of Britain. However, to launch a successful invasion, Nazi Germany recognized that they needed to defeat the Royal British Airforce (RAF) and gain air superiority. On July 10th, 1940, under the order of Hitler, the German Luftwaffe attacked coastal defenses, radar stations and airfields — but to no avail, the British defense held strong. For some kind of breakthrough, and also in retaliation to the RAF bombing Berlin, Nazi Germany launches large scale bombings targeting cities with high populations and economic importance - such as London, Liverpool, etc - for 55 days and 57 consecutive nights in a period known as the Blitz. However, British moral stood firm, and with the introduction of the radar, the RAF eventually suppressed the Luftwaffe, controlling the airspace. With a depleted and now weaker air force, Hitler was forced to withdraw immediate intentions of invading Britain, marking his first major defeat in the war.

                            Was the codename by Axis Powers for the invasion of the Soviet Union and was Nazi Germany’s ideological goal to create “living space” for Germans to populate. This operation began after the German failure in Operation Sea Lion, and saw the mobilization of over three million Germany finest soldiers across Eastern Europe. The Germans found initial success, reaching all the way to the outskirts of Moscow; but due to gross overconfidence and underestimation of Soviet military prowess, the Red Army pushed back their German occupiers. The mass production of the T-34 Russia tanks that smashed through the ill equipped and dressed German soldiers, as well as numerous military mistakes by Hitler, and the seemingly endless supply of Russian reserve soldiers, spelled failure of Operation Barbarossa. The defeat in Russia was the turning point of WW2 for Germany, with this loss, Germany was now vulnerable to fight a long and costly two-front war, Germany’s worst nightmare; fighting the two fronts foreshadowed the fall of Nazi Germany.

                        The Enigma machine is a complex information encryptor that was used by the German military and government to protect vital knowledge about military operations & tactics. It was impossibly secure, changing keys and data tables daily, the Enigma machine was almost unbreakable. However, due to human errors committed by German operators, it was cracked by a British cryptologist - namely a man named Alan Turner - and this discovery gave the edge to the Allies in the war of intelligence, saving hundreds of Allied vessels and lives.

                            Known also as the 900 day siege, the Siege of Leningrad was the German occupation of the lands surrounding the Soviet industrial city of Leningrad (now known as Petrograd); cutting the city off vital railway and supply lines. Boasting the second largest population in the Soviet Union, the siege of Leningrad was a Russian catastrophe that claimed 800,000 civilian lives as a result of famine, harsh winter weather, German bombings, and a severe lack of supplies. Though many of his own people were dying, Stalin capitalized on this situation to motivate and create high morale as well as foster a sense of national unity to fight the Germans. For this purpose, Stalin purposely delayed the rescue of Leningrad for months; which one can argue, has paid off as by early January of 1943, the Russians were able to slowly retake territory and launch a counteroffensive that would eventually see the Red army reach the streets of Berlin.

                            The attack on Pearl Harbor was the preemptive attack by the Japanese on the US military stronghold of Pearl Harbor in the Asian Theatre. On December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise aerial strike on American military ships docked in Pearl Harbor; the attack can be considered a major success for the Japanese, as they were able to sink significant America naval assets and dealt a critical blow American sea capabilities. However, the attack had several deficiencies that allowed for an American revival: the first was the Japanese failure to destroy American repair factories and oil refinement centres, which allowed for many of the ships to be repaired and supplied with oil. The next was somewhat a lucky break for the Americans, where on the morning of the attack, major American battleships like Virginia and Pennsylvania were out in a test run. Though the attack on Pearl Harbor was a stunning triumph for the Japanese, it was also a catastrophe that woke the sleeping giant that was the US and brought her into the war.

The battle of the Philippines was a major defeat for the joint Amerian and Philippino forces that failed to halt the Japanese war machine from advancing further down Asia.

                            The Burma Campaign was a series of battles fought primarily between the British, British India, China, and support from the US against Imperial Japan in the British colony of Burma. The campaign was a very prolonged conflict, beginning from the onset of Allied intervention in 1942, and lasting to nearly the end of WW2. This was due to mainly two factors: underdeveloped infrastructure and terrible weather conditions in the region meant that supplies and troops were slow on the uptake and made fighting difficult; the outbreak of disease, disorder in India, and a priority to defeat Nazi Germany, depleted the troops nescessary for an Allied success.  This allowed for initial Japanese victories, such as Japanese invasion of Burma, but eventually — as soldiers and resources started to be invested by the Allies — the Allied forces launched a successful counteroffensive that retook Burma in early 1945 to late 1945.

The main objective of the campaign was to secure the island from Japanese hands to neutralise its threat as a launchpoint that Japan can use to disrupt Allied supply and communication lines. Allied forces quickly overwhelmed the outnumbered Japanese stationed soldiers in a surprise attack, and took the strategic airfield of Henderson Field. The Japanese, however, soon launch counter offensives that saw major land and naval battles in an attempt to retake the island — ultimately ending in the Naval battle of Giadalcanal, with a decisive Japanese defeat. Guadalcanal marked the beginning of the Allied offensive in the Asian Theater, as well as hinting at the retreat of Japan.

The weakening of Nazi Germany’s resulted in the halting of the German advance into  Eastern Europe; with the Red Army pushing German lines further back, the battle of Stalingrad, in many ways, signaled the immenient end of Nazi Germany.

                            The ONS 5 was the 5th of the numbered ONS series of Slow trade convoys Outbound from the British Isles to North America. Consisting of 43 ships, the ONS 5 were trade ships that were bound from Liverpool to Halifax. The significance of the ONS 5 was its involvement in the Battle of the North Atlantic: where, over the course of a week, the ONS 5 was attacked by 40 U-Boats and lost over 13 ships — but also invoked heavily losses to the German U-Boat, destroying six and seriously damaging seven. This battle with the ONS 5 demonstrated that convoy escorts were now proficient in protecting convoy ships and showed the improving ability of Allied forces to repel, and inflict damage onto, U-Boat attacks. The incident with the ONS 5 marked the turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic and ushered in Black May, a period were German U-Boats suffered enormous casualties compared to minimal Allied losses; establishing Allied victory over the Atlantic.

                    <p>
                            The Battle of Kursk was an unsuccessful German assault on Russian forces on the city of Kursk, in an effort to shift the tides of war and create a breakthrough in the Soviet defenses. The Germans ultimately lost the battle - though they had the tactical advantage - due to Soviets having the advantage of the terrain as well as strong fortifications and stockpile of troops and tanks. Taking place shortly before the battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, began to cement the Soviet resurgence and the decreasing likelihood of the German taking Russia.

                            The Allied invasion of Italy was the well known, Allied amphibious military landing on mainland Italy during the early stages of the Italian campaign. Following the successful invasion and capture of the island of Sicily, Allied troops were landed around the city of Salerno in Operation Avalanche — for the purpose of establishing a firm beachhead for future Allied attacks. Though the Germans fought hard to keep the beachhead, eventually they withdrew allowed the Allied to secure another victory. The allied invasion of Italy was important as it provided a critical Allied foothold and influence in southern Italy, which would prove to be essential for the Allies in the Italian campaign(Jul. 10, 1943 – May 8, 1945) and the fall of fascit Italy.

                            Was the strategic conference between the leaders of the three powerhouses of the Allies: Joseph Stalin (Russia), Franklin D. Roosevelt (US), and Winston Churchill (UK), to mainly discuss the Allie’s objective of opening a second, western, front against Germany. With Germany fighting in the Eastern front with the Russians, opening up another would significantly pressure German resources. While there was no argument on the necessity of opening a second front, there were still disagreements on how and when to do it — the Tehran Conference was meant to solve this and create agreement between the three powers. During this meeting, Stalin, representing Russia, pressed the United States and UK to engage immediately to open a Western front. Stalin argued that Russian soldiers were dying in the hundred of thousands at the Eastern front while very little was being done on the Western front by the US and UK.

                    <p>
                            The Battle of Monte Cassino was a sequence of four hard-fought assaults by the Allied forces against the Winter Line in Italy. The objective was to breakthrough into Rome and further advance into the Italian territory. Penetrating the Winter Line, a series of heavy fortification held by the Axis powers in Italy to defend it’s western region, was a daunting and costly task for the Allies; over 55, 000 Allied soldiers died compared to 20,000 Germans in the assault. The battle of Monte Cassino, despite it’s heavy price, was an important victory for the Allies as it created a path to Rome, and therefore to the rest of North Italy. Without this win, the Allies would have effectively lost their route to the rest of Italy, and the fall of fascist Italy might have been delayed for several more months.

                            Standing for Day-Day, also known as the invasion of Normandy and code named Operation Overlord, was the Allied invasion on Nazi occupied France to liberate it. Taking place five beaches in coastal Normandy, code named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword; D-Day was the largest Allied amphibious landing and mobilized tremendous portions of the Allied naval and airforce. The battle was one of the most gruesome in WW2 history, with an estimated 10, 000 Allied casualties, as a result of the heavy fortifications that lined the beaches, such as coastal batteries, machine guns and mortars. It was thanks to a combination of very careful preparation by the Allies, the lesson from the failure of Dieppe, and successful deception by the Allies that mislead the Germans on the location of D-day, that D-Day was a success. After the defeat on D-Day, Nazi Germany days were numbered, it was only a matter of until the Allied forces from the Western and Eastern eventually reached Berlin — victory was effectively assured for the Allies, the only question that remained was how soon it would come. D-Day was an incredibly significant event that signaled the end of war in Europe and would make the foundations for the liberation of German occupied countries; it marked the beginning of the end.

                            During Hitler’s rise to power, he fostered an extreme ethno-nationalism within the German people that created, or rather emphasized, a racial hierarchy between them, the pure Aryans, and the “inferior” races. Concentration camps was the product of this racial hatred towards a particular group, Jews, and are famously the site of WW2’s greatest horrors and atrocities committed. These concentration camps, located predominantly in Poland, were slowly discovered by Allied soldiers, mostly the Soviets, as they pushed the German back from their occupied land. There they would find the extreme brutality and bondage that was carried on the Jews — observing the bodies of men and women that were thin to the bone, and finding piles of bodies on certain camps. Majdanek was the first camp to be liberated by the Soviets in July of 1944, by the mid April, 1945, notorious camps such as Auschwitz, Belzec, Chelmno, and others were also freed. By the end of WW2, millions of Jews were systematically murdered in gruesome ways, a genocide that still has a significant impact on modern soceity today.

Victory in Guam gave the US a major military base and harbor that could be used as a launch point for future attacks on Japanese occupied islands.

The offensive intended to split the Allied lines, allowing for the Germans to encircle them and eliminate major Allied armies, in order to force the Allies to sign a treaty in their favour. The battle lasted over 3 weeks under a surprise snowfall, 450, 000 Germans fought the Allied forces, which included 610,000 American soldiers, in fierce confrontations. Initially, the Germans found success attacking weak Allied lines caused from the bad weather and overconfidence, inflicting major casualties on American troops (though receiving massive losses on their side as well).  However, once the weather cleared and the superior allied air force was running, defeat soon followed for the Germans. The largest and bloodiest battle for the US, the victory in the Battle of the Bulge ensured that the war would end sooner with fewer casualties than it would have if the Allies lost.

                            Code named Operation Detachment by the Americans, the Battle of Iwo was the intense, three week, confrontation between the American military and the forces of Imperial Japan, on the island of Iwo Jima. The objective of the operation was to take the Japan held island of Iwo Jima and establish it as a strategic staging area for future military attack on Japan; though it’s strategic value came into question as the battle went on and more American soldiers died. Fighting was ferocious: even though American soldiers had an overwhelming advantage in air superiority and resources — having no real way to lose — against the Japanese soldiers with sparse food supplies and no hope for reinforcements, Japan fought to the last man, never surrendering despite the situation. This Japanese pride, and willingness to die for honor, cost the American military 26, 000 casualties while Japan deaths were under 18, 000 (out of 21, 000 soldiers). The Battle of Iwo Jima was the first major battle to take place on the Japanese homeland, and was the beginning of the American advance into Japan.

                            As the American and Allied forces reached closer to the Japanese homeland, so did the desperation of Japanese to protect; the battle of Okinawa was a major Pacific battle that exemplified the extreme savagery and sacrifice of the Japanese to defend their country. Fought shorty after the battle of Iwo on the Japanese island of Okinawa, Operation Iceberg sought to capture the island and continue the Allied invasion of Japan. The battle was fierce, even more so than Iwo, with the Japanese soldiers deploying  kamikaze attacks and sucide bombings on Allied naval ships, artillery, and tanks — inflicting heavy damage to the enormous amounts of Allied forces landed on the island. However, both sides faced significant loses: Allied loses was at least 75, 000, while Japan had a minimum casualty of 84, 000 soldiers and under 150, 000 Okinawa citizens (half of Okinawa’s population at the time). The battle of Okinawa, the second largest amphibious landing in WW2, was a major battle in the Pacific Theater that hinted, in many ways, the defeat of Japan in WW2; a defeat that would be sealed in the nuclear bombings of Hiroshsima and Nagasaki.

After six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, on August 15 (VJ Day) the government of Japan announced its surrender — concluding WW2.
